- Clustering Model Based on Citation Trends – Identifying patterns to improve forecasting.
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) & Neural Networks – Enhancing prediction accuracy.
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis – Fine-tuning model performance.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing & Cleanup)
- Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Networks (Predictive Models)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Model Performance
- Applied Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to reduce data inconsistencies.
- Clustered citation patterns to refine trend analysis and improve 2022 forecasts.
- Conducted comparative model analysis to determine the best forecasting approach.
- Used bias-variance tradeoff to optimize model efficacy.
